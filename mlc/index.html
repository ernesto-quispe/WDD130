            <h2>Recycling</h2>
            <p> The Department of Waste Management, in conjunction with the Environmental Ministry, has worked closely with the Beautifying Committee and other municipal organizations to improve the quality of outdoor life for the residents of the community. One of their focuses has been to formulate a plan to prevent micro-dumps in different parts of the city. These micro-dumps are formed when trash or unused equipment is illegally dumped in secluded or badly surveilled public spaces. One of the suggested solutions is to provide regular junk removal service to the residents which would reduce the need for our residents to dispose of them in other ways.

            <h2>Reforestation</h2>
            <p> On Saturday, June 3, municipal teams and volunteers from the commune worked and planted new trees in the San Juan Pablo II Park. Reforestation is part of the interventions that have been projected with the Volunteer Unit, an initiative created by the Municipality of Las Condes, to promote citizen participation and social commitment in the commune. The tree species were selected taking into account the needs of the park and the recommendations of experts in urban ecology. They correspond to native trees with a great capacity to improve biodiversity, provide shade and beautify the intervened environment. This was the first action of a series of interventions that will be carried out in different parts of the commune. This year it is planned to plant more than 1,000 trees in Las Condes, with the aim of beautifying green spaces and protecting the environment.

            <h2>Vaccination</h2>
            <p> As of March 1, Juan Pablo II Park will be the only municipal vaccination center in the commune. To meet the demand, it will have a total of 90 inoculation points at its maximum capacity. The Municipality of Las Condes arranged a single vaccination center in Juan Pablo II Park, a decision that was made as a way to make the vaccination process against covid-19 more efficient. The entrance to the vaccination center is located at Av. Pdte. Riesco 6300 and will work from Monday to Friday, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., attending in order of arrival (service numbers will be given from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.). The enclosure is equipped with a large tent that houses the vaccination area. This allows physical distancing between those who attend the place; It also has differentiated accesses, waiting rooms and temporary parking lots.
